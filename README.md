# 107transfer
This is an Epitech project where a laboratory performs tests on new electronic components to be integrated into its last generation chipset.
Those components are entirely characterized by their transfer function, which determines frequency response; this function processes the input frequency and computes an output frequency.

## Installation
run this code to clone the current repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:amdjadouxx/107transfer.git
```

## Usage
A transfer function is defined by two strings (one for the numerator, one for the denominator), composed
by the polynomial coefficients split by the ‘*’ sign.
```bash
./107transfer "1*2*3*4*5" "1"
```
